What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

    I think that taking it one section at a time and re-reading through the instructions several times really worked for me and helped me sort of drill the aspects that my code needed into my brain. However, staring at a blank screen as I did for many hours definitely didn't help me get any further, and I think that that time could be better spent either doing Pseudocode or just getting help/asking questions. I didn't really know how to start this assignment, but I think that taking it slowly helped me feel less overwhelmed, so I would definitely recommend that to anyone taking this course in the future. Giving myself plenty of time to make sense of the instructions and the pieces of the code individually helped a lot with my understanding.
